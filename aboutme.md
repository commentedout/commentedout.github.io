Hi, I’m **Saurabh**.


I’m a Software Engineer based in Pune, India. I specialize in designing and developing back end applications. I have developed front ends for applications during a substantial part of my professional career but currently, I focus primarily on back ends. I have a special interest in system design and application security.

This blog is my attempt to share with others what I have learnt after putting in hours of effort.

If you have any suggestions for me or have any question feel free to contact me at [cmmtout@gmail.com](mailto:cmmtout@gmail.com).
